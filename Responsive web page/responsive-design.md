# Responsive Design Requirements Documentation

## Overview
This website is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different form factors including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The implementation uses modern web technologies to ensure optimal viewing and interaction experiences across all devices.

## Layout Adaptation Strategies

### Desktop (Width > 768px)
- Multi-column layout using CSS Grid
- Full navigation menu displayed horizontally
- Larger padding and font sizes
- Hover effects on interactive elements

### Tablet (Width 481px - 768px)
- Single column layout with flexbox
- Navigation menu converts to vertical layout
- Slightly reduced padding
- Form elements stack vertically

### Mobile (Width â‰¤ 480px)
- Single column layout
- Collapsible navigation menu (hamburger menu)
- Minimal padding to maximize screen space
- Font sizes adjusted for readability
- Form inputs optimized for touch

## Image and Media Handling
- All images use `max-width: 100%` to prevent overflow
- Height set to auto to maintain aspect ratio
- No fixed dimensions that could cause layout issues

## Navigation Adaptation
- Desktop: Horizontal menu bar
- Tablet: Vertical menu items
- Mobile: Hamburger menu toggle

## Print Optimization
- Separate print stylesheet removes:
  - Background colors and images
  - Navigation elements
  - Non-essential decorative elements
- Adds URLs after links
- Optimizes content flow to prevent page breaks in awkward places
- Uses a clean, readable font size and spacing

## Device Detection
- JavaScript detects device type via user agent
- Can apply specific adjustments if needed
- Primary layout handled by CSS media queries
- Mobile menu toggle for small screens

## Testing Requirements
Website should be tested on:
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Tablet devices (iPad, Android tablets) in both portrait and landscape
- Mobile devices (iPhone, Android phones) in both orientations
- Print preview function in major browsers
